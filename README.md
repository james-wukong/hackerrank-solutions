## This's mainly done when I was trying to do exercises in Hackerrank

[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is a very good platform to do all these practices.

These scripts are basically my solutions, and some of them might need have some optimization done. They are literally basic implementations of algorithms that help understand both algorithms and the programming language.

## TODO

I haven't comment the algorithms in the code yet.
